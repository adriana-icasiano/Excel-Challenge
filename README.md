## 2) 2185 successful campaigns provide indicators for optimal campaign attributes. ##
 ### i.	Campaigns launched in May have the highest success. ###   
 While the other months have similar number of successful campaigns, the Month of May have a slightly higher success rate than other months.

 ### iii.	The median goal amount is $3,500. ### 
 The goal amount ranged from $1 to $400,000. However, the median goal amount is $3,500, and the upper bound for outlier is $22,750.
 ### iv.	The median percent pledged is 112% of goal. ### 
 The upper bound for outlier is 189% of goal meaning it is highly unlikely for the pledge amount to go beyond the said percentage.
 ### v.	The lower the goal amount the higher likelihood of success. ### 
 Goal set between $15,000 and 19,999 has a 47% of chance of success, 45% of failure and 8% of cancelation, meaning there is only a 2% gap in the chance of success and failure.
