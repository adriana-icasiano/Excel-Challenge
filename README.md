## Summary ##
Kickstarter is a popular platform for crowdfunding campaigns in the arts. Campaigns related to theater plays, documentary and rock are the most common and successful. Successful is defined as *100% or more of the fundraising goal met*. Due to the nature of the business, tghe data values are widely spread out from the mean - for example, campaign goals ranged from $1 to $400,000. Although theatrical play is the most popular subcategory and raised the most dollars in total, it has a higher failure rate. The high failure rate of theatrical plays campaigns may be improved by spending on marketing tools from Kickstarter, such as spotlight.

## Analysis ##
### 1. Fundraisers in theatrical plays, documentaries and rock music industries from US, Canada and UK make up most Kickstarter campaigns.   
The top three most successful categories are in the Theater, Music and Film & Video categories. Within those categories, the top three most successful sub-categories are theatrical plays, documentary and rock music. As such some of our analysis is focused on these sub-categories. Refer to  [Table 1 Successful vs Failure Percentages by Category](https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/9ffd2485729ed910c9da63ddc2c2a7a5e59f67e0/Chart%203.PNG)

### 2) Successful campaigns provide pointers for key campaign attributes. ###
   > a) While the other months have similar number of successful campaigns, the month of May have a slightly higher success rate than other months. Refer to [Table 2 Successful Campaigns by Launch Month](https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/ba0cbe901e4c649212892871ba9321deb16738cf/Chart%209.PNG)

   > b) The median campaign duration is 30 days. The duration of successful campaigns varied between 2 to 90 days; however, the average duration is 30 days.
   
   > c) The median goal amount is $3,500. The goal amount ranged from $1 to $400,000. However, the median goal amount is $3,500, and the upper bound for outlier is $22,750. Tyically campaigns that failed or cancelled have relatively high dollar amounts. Refer to [Table 3 Goals Dollars by State and Subcategory](https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/3bd6d2c56fa51723346032022a7053ae0a1301ef/Chart%2013.PNG) and [Table 4 Goals Scatter Plot](https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/3a202e31f417086dffe65c9dbf2ffb0b823c8376/Chart%2016.PNG)

   > d) The median percent pledged is 112% of goal. The upper bound for outlier is 189% of goal meaning it is highly unlikely for the pledge amount to go beyond this percentage.

   > e) The lower the goal amount the higher likelihood of success except for the goal range $15,000 and 19,999. Goal set between $15,000 and 19,999 has a 47% of chance of success, 45% of failure and 8% of cancelation, meaning there is only a 2% gap in the chance of success and failure. Refer to  [Table 5 Goal vs. Percentage Pledge]( https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/bb782020a2b83f9cec5b96901f4eb5db9eebfaa9/Chart%207.PNG)

### 3) Use of spotlight or other marketing assistance reduce failure rate. ### 
In general, campaigns that used spotlight were successful and those who did not failed. In the theatrical plays sub-category, the total goal in dollars for failed campaigns is higher than successful campaigns. Documentary and rock campaigns, which had zero canceled or failed campaigned. 100% of failed theatrical campaigns did not use the marketing feature "spotlight" and all successful campagins did use the marketing feature, which indicates the high effectiveness of the tool. Refer to [Table 6 Spotlight vs. Success Rate](https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/0f278756ba7ffe2c27cd8243307e296186df0cc8/Chart%2012.PNG)

## Data Limitation ##
> 1.  It was difficult to find a representative median from the data because the goals varied widely. 
> 2.	There are very limited successful datapoints. At only ~4000 data points, it is hard to get an accurate analysis and create meaningful trendlines. 
> 3.	The data doesnâ€™t show if any money was spent on efforts spent on advertising or marketing help from Kickstarter such as BoostYourCampaign services or other professional Kickstarter marketing companies.
> 4.	There are various outliers that make it challenging to analyze the data. For example, the campaigns with goal amounts of $1 to $50 are outliers, but they skew the data for successful campaigns


## Additional Tables and Graphs ##
> 1.	A scatter plot of campaigns on a map so viewer can get an idea of how the usage spreadout geographically.
> 2.	A table of failed campaigns and spotlight attribute to analyze the impact of the spotlight feature. Did not having it possible cause the failure? Did having it not make an impact at all?
> 3.	Bar graphs of categories and sub-categories

## Bonus Statistical ##
> 1.	The dataset has many extremes. For example, the number of backers for successful campaigns has a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 26457. The average of this range which is 194.42 would not be representative of the population. Therefore, the median being the middle of the data would summarize more meaningfully.

> 2.	The variance of successful campaigns is much higher than the failed ones. This makes sense because there is no limitation as to how many backers can back a campaign. If it is popular it can have as little as 1 or as many backers there are to support the campaign. Failed campaign is likely to have 0 to a number of backers that tends to be low; therefore, there is less variability in the smaller range.
