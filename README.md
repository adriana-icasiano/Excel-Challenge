## Summary ##
Kickstarter is a popular platform for crowdfunding campagins in the arts. Campaigns related to theater, music and film are the most common. Successful is defined as 100% or more of the fundraising goal was met. Documentary and rock music campaigns have zero failure rate, while theatrical plays campaigns have a higher failure rate than success rate. The high failture rate of theatrical plays campaigns may benefit from more targeted marketing assistance from Kickstarter.

## Analysis ##
### 1. The majority of Kickstarter campaigns are in music and film in the US, Canada and UK.   
The top three most successful categories are in the Theater, Music and Film & Video categories. Within those categories, the top three most successful sub-categories are theatrical plays, documentary and rock music.  Refer to  [Table 1 Successful vs Failture Percentages by Category](https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/9ffd2485729ed910c9da63ddc2c2a7a5e59f67e0/Chart%203.PNG)

### 2) Successful campaigns provide pointers for key campaign attributes. ###
   > a) Campaigns launched in May are slightly more successful. While the other months have similar number of successful campaigns, the Month of May have a slightly higher success rate than other months. 
   > b) The median campaign duration is 30 days. The duration of successful campaigns varied between 2 to 90 days; however, the average duration is 30 days.
   
   > c) The median goal amount is $3,500. The goal amount ranged from $1 to $400,000. However, the median goal amount is $3,500, and the upper bound for outlier is $22,750.

   > d) The median percent pledged is 112% of goal. The upper bound for outlier is 189% of goal meaning it is highly unlikely for the pledge amount to go beyond the said percentage.

   > e) The lower the goal amount the higher likelihood of success except for the goal range $15,000 and 19,999. Goal set between $15,000 and 19,999 has a 47% of chance of success, 45% of failure and 8% of cancelation, meaning there is only a 2% gap in the chance of success and failure. Refer to  [Table 2 Goal vs. Percentage Pledge]( https://github.com/adriana-icasiano/Excel-Challenge/blob/bb782020a2b83f9cec5b96901f4eb5db9eebfaa9/Chart%207.PNG)

### 3) Fundraisers for plays may benefit more targeted marketing assistance from Kickstarter. ### 
While many campaigns are started in the the theatrical plays sub-category, this particular sub-category had higher dollars in failed campaigns than successful campaigns. Meanwhile, other popular sub-cateogires such as documentary and rock campaigns had zero canceled or failed campaigned - i.e. a success rate of 100%.
